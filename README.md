# LiverLens-Revolutionizing-Multi-Modal-Fatty-Liver-Detection-Through-AI-Synergy
This project aims to develop an innovative AI-driven system for the detection, classification, and management of Fatty Liver Disease (FLD) through a multi-modal approach. The system will synergize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and dense neural networks, Autokeras, hyperparameter optimization, etc to analyze ultrasound images and process clinical and biometric data. The final product will deliver an advanced, user-centric platform that empowers individuals to monitor and improve their liver health through personalized insights, AI-powered Q/A, and engaging visualizations.
